<p><b>Abstract: </b>With increasing technology each sector needs to be modernized. With the improvement of clever gadgets, the system can now be controlled virtually with the aid of using human gestures. While using paint, sometimes we feel it is difficult to draw and feel like drawing our imagination just by waving our hand. The existing technologies allows us to draw just by waving hand uses technology or methodology which takes a lot of process and time. Avoiding or decreasing these limitations we came up with the Air Canvas System that uses new technologies and easy methodologies. The Air Canvas makes a speciality of growing a motion-to-textual converter. The proposed system works on hand tracking system development which aims to track the hand which acts as pen and functions as pen to create or draw different shapes and also as an eraser using Open Computer Vision Library(Open-CV) and MediaPipe.  System Camera is used to track the hand and create drawings.</p>
